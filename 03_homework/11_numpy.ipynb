The formula for exponential growth is `population_size = N0 *e**rt`, where `N0` is the initial population, `e` is the exponential function, `r` is the rate, and `t` is time. Using this:\n","\n","1.   Set the initial population, `N0`, as 100 and the growth rate, `r`, as 0.4\n","2.   Use the suitable `numpy` function to generate an array of time points, `t`, which go from 0 to 10 seconds, in 0.2 second increments.\n","3.   Write an expression to evaluate `population_size`, which should be an array of the population size for each time point in `t`.\n","4.   Create a new variable called `population_size_noise`, use the same expression you wrote in parts (3), and add noise to the population at each time point. Do this by adding an expression that uses a `numpy` function to generate a random value for each time point drawn from a normal distribution of `mean=0` and `stdev=250` (i.e., population_size_noise = expression_from_part_a + expression_to_add_noise)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":7,"status":"ok","timestamp":1668296875008,"user":{"displayName":"Kaylie Lau","userId":"01284785813595846851"},"user_tz":300},"id":"ULSswoS4EhRs","outputId":"6d541d46-0b4f-4300-9d52-bfd6d4877aff"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Population size is:\n"," [ 100.          108.32870677  117.3510871   127.12491503  137.71277643\n","  149.18246976  161.60744022  175.06725003  189.64808793  205.44332106\n","  222.55409285  241.08997064  261.16964734  282.92170144  306.48542033\n","  332.01169227  359.66397256  389.61933018  422.0695817   457.22251951\n","  495.30324244  536.55559711  581.24373944  629.6538261   682.09584693\n","  738.90560989  800.44689143  867.11376585  939.33312874 1017.56743061\n"," 1102.31763806 1194.12644178 1293.58173155 1401.32036077 1518.0322245\n"," 1644.46467711 1781.42731796 1929.79717555 2090.52432351 2264.63796432\n"," 2453.25301971 2657.57726999 2878.91908792 3118.69581683 3378.44284638\n"," 3659.82344437 3964.63940726 4294.84259788 4652.54744398 5040.04447781]\n","\n","Population size with noise is:\n"," [ 154.82601996  229.93004884   80.81109051  190.97683387   30.47776467\n","  628.29964707  438.084728     81.29187248  174.13508341  374.76845126\n","  271.60879099   85.17066683   85.67033044  -42.03072007   31.21806647\n","  276.85303555  -84.27262924  578.125883    122.32896052  301.3426629\n","  533.01925032  537.92192185  300.22707286  871.18457498  881.26632047\n","  865.36544339  705.77387271  696.3120634  1318.45735759  713.94522753\n"," 1569.67157503  823.01634858  862.35093011  985.5046342  1579.40802676\n"," 1418.29307647 1894.2849229  1525.1591985  2109.76245099 2628.93538424\n"," 2327.89960821 2433.0975658  2928.17035077 3335.33737944 3425.62303609\n"," 3433.17185501 4016.03834561 4039.94449962 4537.97720327 4765.85156377]\n"]}],"source":["# Your code here\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","N0 = 100\n","r = 0.4\n","\n","t = np.arange(start=0, stop=10, step=0.2)\n","\n","population_size = N0 * np.exp(r*t)\n","\n","print(\"Population size is:\\n\", population_size)\n","\n","population_size_noise = N0 * np.exp(r*t) + np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=250, size=np.shape(population_size))\n","\n","print(\"\\nPopulation size with noise is:\\n\", population_size_noise)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<details>\n","  <summary>Answer</summary>\n","\n","  ```python\n","  import numpy as np\n","\n","  #set initial population\n","  N0 = 100\n","  #set growth rate\n","  rate = 0.4\n","  #create array of time points \n","  t = np.arange(start=0, stop=10.2, step=0.2)\n","\n","  #calculate population of colony at the time points in t\n","  population_size = N0 * np.exp(rate*t)\n","  print('Population size is: ',population_size)\n","\n","  #add noise to population at each time point\n","  population_size_noise = N0 * np.exp(rate*t) + np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=250, size=np.shape(population_size))\n","  print('Population size with noise is: ',population_size_noise)\n","  ```\n","</details>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QmxvYhS3OCNJ"},"source":["### 2.
